# Web Proxies and Web Information Gathering

Testing and modifying web requests being sent to web servers or web applications make up the majority of Web Application Penetration Testing. In order to intercept and modify the requests being sent between browsers and web applications we need to utilize Web Proxies. Web Proxies like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP play a vital role in web application penetration testing and are pivotal in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Web Proxies make the process of intercepting and replaying web requests much more efficient. As a result, web proxies are considered among the most important tools for any web app pentester.

This course will introduce you to web proxies like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP and will cover the process of utilizing these web proxies in order to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in web applications. The goal of this course is to get you comfortable with using both Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for web app pentesting.

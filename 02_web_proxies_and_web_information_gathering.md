# Web Proxies and Web Information Gathering

Testing and modifying web requests being sent to web servers or web applications make up the majority of Web Application Penetration Testing. In order to intercept and modify the requests being sent between browsers and web applications we need to utilize Web Proxies. Web Proxies like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP play a vital role in web application penetration testing and are pivotal in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Web Proxies make the process of intercepting and replaying web requests much more efficient. As a result, web proxies are considered among the most important tools for any web app pentester.

This course will introduce you to web proxies like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP and will cover the process of utilizing these web proxies in order to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in web applications. The goal of this course is to get you comfortable with using both Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for web app pentesting.

## Burp Suite

### Burp Suite Intruder

#### Lab Environment

**Directory Enumeration with Burp Suite**

Web Application Pentesting Tools can prove to be very helpful while performing penetration testing.Â 

In this lab exercise, we will take a look at how to useÂ [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/support/burp-suite-tools)Â to perform directory enumeration onÂ theÂ [Mutillidae](https://github.com/webpwnized/mutillidae)Â web application.Â Â 

**Objective**:Â <u>Perform directory enumeration with Burp Suite</u>.

Instructions:Â 
- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
- Once you start the lab,Â you will have access to a Kali GUI instance.
- Your Kali instance has an interface with IP address `192.X.Y.2`. Run `ip addr` to know the values of X and Y.
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address `192.X.Y.1`.
- Use Directory wordlist: `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`.

#### Lab Solution

`ifconfig eth1`:
```
eth1: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.120.4.2ðŸ“Œ netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.120.4.255

### Burp Suite Repeater

#### Lab Environment

**Vulnerable Online Calculator - Code Injection**

[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)Â is an awareness document, which outlines the most critical security risks to web applications. Pentesting is performed according to the OWASP TOP 10 standard to reduce/mitigate the security risks.

In the exercise, we will focus onÂ [OWASP A1 Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)Â flaws and we will take a look at how to perform Python code injection attack on a vulnerable calculator web application. The backend generates the result using the Python "eval" function to make the workflow simpler.

**Objective:**Â <u>Interact with the webapp and perform Code Injection</u>.

Instructions:Â 
- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
- Once you start the lab, you will have access to a Kali GUI instance.
- Your Kali instance has an interface with IP address `192.X.Y.2`. Run `ifconfig` to know the values of X and Y.
- The application should be running on port `5000` on the machine located at the IP address `192.X.Y.3`.
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address `192.X.Y.1`.

## Tools and Frameworks

- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)
	Burp Suite isÂ a widely-used tool for web application security testing, offering a platform to perform security assessments and identify vulnerabilities. Developed by PortSwigger, it is a proprietary software tool for security assessment and penetration testing of web applications.
	- Key Features:
		- **Burp Proxy**: Enables web crawling by automatically mapping out and scanning web applications, building a structural map for testing.
		- **Burp Logger and HTTP History**: Logs HTTP requests and responses for analysis and debugging.
		- **Burp Intercept**: Captures and intercepts in-motion HTTP requests, allowing for modification and replay.
		- **Burp Scanner**: Aggregates reports indicating weaknesses and vulnerabilities, using a built-in database containing known-unsafe syntax patterns and keywords.
	- Editions:
		- **Community Edition**: A free version with limited features, suitable for beginners and small-scale testing.
		- **Professional Edition**: A paid version with additional features, such as the scanner, suitable for professional web app security researchers and bug bounty hunters.
		- **Enterprise Edition**: A paid version with advanced features, including automated scanning and scalability, suitable for large-scale enterprise environments.
	- Additional Capabilities
		- **BApps**: External components that can be integrated into Burp Suite to enhance its capabilities, similar to browser extensions.
		- **Extender**: A window for viewing, modifying, installing, and uninstalling BApps.

- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
	OWASP ZAPÂ (Zed Attack Proxy) isÂ a powerful, open-source dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool designed to help web developers and IT security professionals identify security vulnerabilities in web applications. It is not intended for casual users, but rather for functional testers, web developers, and those with experience in penetration testing or general IT security.
	- Key Features:
		- **Intercepting Proxy**: OWASP ZAP can act as an accurate intercepting proxy, allowing users to view requests made to a web application and their responses, including AJAX calls. Breaking points can be set to control these requests and responses live.
		- **Comprehensive and Feature-Rich**: Despite its intuitive interface, OWASP ZAP is a feature-rich tool with a wide range of capabilities, including automated scanners and manual penetration testing methods.
		- **Scalability**: OWASP ZAP can be used as a proxy server, allowing users to manipulate all traffic passing through it, including HTTPS encrypted traffic.
		- **Daemon Mode and REST-Based API**: OWASP ZAP can run in daemon mode, controlled via a REST-based API, making it suitable for automated testing and integration with other tools.

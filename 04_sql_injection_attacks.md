# SQL Injection Attacks

SQL Injection is one of the most commonly exploited injection vulnerabilities in web applications and poses a serious security risk to organizations. As a web application pentester or bug bounty hunter, it is vitally important to understand what causes SQL Injection vulnerabilities, how they can be identified, and how they can be exploited. The ability for attackers to run arbitrary queries against vulnerable systems can result in data exposure, modification, and in some cases, entire system compromise. SQL Injection vulnerabilities are often misunderstood and overlooked by developers primarily due to a lack of knowledge on how SQL queries can be weaponized by attackers.

This course will take you through everything from introducing you to SQL Injection, explaining the difference between In-Band, Blind, and Out-of-band SQLi, and will show you how to identify and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications through a mix of both manual and automated techniques.

## Course Introduction

### Course Topic Overview

- Introduction to SQL Injection
- Types of SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
- Introduction to Databases, DBMS, Relational Databases and NoSQL Databases
- SQL Fundamentals
- Hunting for SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
- Identifying and Exploiting In-Band SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Error-Based and UNION-Based SQLi)
- Identifying and Exploiting Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Time-Based and Boolean-Based SQLi)
- Identifying and Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities with Automated Tools (i.e. SQLMap)
- Pentesting NoSQL Databases

### Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with HTTP/HTTPS
- Basic familiarity with Linux
- Basic familiarity with OWASP ZAP/Burp Suite

### Learning Objectives

- You will have a solid understanding of what a SQL injection vulnerabilities are, what causes them and their potential impact.
- You will have an understanding of how Relational Databases and NoSQL databases work and how they differ from one another.
- You will have an understanding of the three different categories/types of SQL Injection vulnerabilities and their respective subtypes.
- You will be able to understand and write basic SQL queries.
- You will be able to identify and exploit In-Band SQL Injection vulnerabilities (Error-Based and UNION-Based SQLi).
- You will be able to identify and exploit Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities (Time-Based and Boolean-Based SQLi).
- You will be able to automate the identification and exploitation of SQL Injection vulnerabilities with tools like SQLMap.
- You will be able to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases.

## In-Band SQL Injection

### Exploiting Error-Based SQLi Vulnerabilities

#### Lab Environment

**PHPMyRecipes**

The attacker might not have any user level access to the web application. However, this does not mean that the application¬†cannot be compromised remotely. SQL Injection vulnerabilities could be triggered even by unauthenticated users.

In the exercise below, the attacker is unauthenticated to the web application and needs to find an SQL Injection attack on it.

<u>A version of¬†PHPMyRecipes¬†is vulnerable¬†to an SQL injection¬†attack</u>.

**Objective**:¬†Your task is to find and exploit this vulnerability.

### Exploiting Union-Based SQLi Vulnerabilities

#### Lab Environment

**Vulnerable Results Portal: Union Based SQLi**

College Exams are over and the results are out! ABC University had released the exam results on the portal developed by their college students.

One of the student found that the portal was vulnerable to Union-based SQL Injection!

**Note**:¬†The backend database is SQLite.

**Objective**:¬†Leverage the vulnerability to determine the SQLite version and the dump flag from the database!

# Web Service Security Testing

In the complex world of web applications, web services play a pivotal role in enabling the seamless exchange of data and functionality between applications over the internet. Web services, particularly those built using the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) framework, have become essential components of modern web applications. However, the convenience they offer comes with inherent security challenges that demand expert attention.

In this course you will uncover the core principles of web application service security testing with a specialized focus on SOAP-based web services. This course will dive deep into the world of web services, the backbone of modern applications, enabling seamless data exchange and functionality sharing across the digital landscape.
It will explore the critical security vulnerabilities that threaten these services, including SQL Injection, Command Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This course will provide you with hands-on experience in identifying, assessing, and exploiting these vulnerabilities and will equip you with essential skills required to test web applications and their underlying SOAP-based web services in an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape.
